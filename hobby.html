<p>I love cooking because it makes me happy in my life. Whenever I feel sad or frustrated, cooking eases me in a big way. I started cooking when I was 6 years old,<br> but it was as simple as putting ham and cheese between 2 slices of bread and using my favorite maynaise seasoning and letting it heat up for about 30 seconds.<br> As I grew older, my knowledge about food deepened when I learned how to cook wastern food. My father also supported my passion for cooking.<br> My father is the only reason I got better since he explained to me how to use the temperature control.Cooking is the only thing I know the best way and <br>I usually cook for family, relatives, friends or people I don't know.Sometimes, I cook more than one thing for homeless people and harass them all over town.<br> My favorite thing to cook is vegetables because I don't like them, but if someone asks for it on their plate, I won't want to cook it.
<br>
<br>
Besides cooking, I also like to travel because by traveling I can learn people's cooking. besides that, traveling<br> can also make us happy and know their customs and culture.Among the countries I have traveled to is Thailand. <br>In Thailand I was able to learn the recipe for making tomyam.That's the only hobby I do nowadays. God willing, I will explore the whole world. </p>
