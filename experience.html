<p style="font-family:'Nanum Myeongjo', serif;">I started working as a cashier after I finished SPM. At first I didn't want to work as a cashier because I was shy to face customers. If you work in a factory,<br> you don't have to deal with people because you focus on the same job. But I braved myself to work as a cashier at<br> Texas Chicke in Klang Parade, Selangor.

Before being hired as a cashier, I was asked to answer some math questions. After that I was given a special uniform for cashier workers only. <br>The next day I was asked to come early at 9 am. Because I was still new, I was given training before opening my own counter. <br>If you have opened your own counter, if there is a short, you will cut your salary. This is where I learned many different types of customers.<br> I used to get angry because the food arrived late. It is also possible for a cashier to get angry about something that has nothing to do with it.<br> I once got angry because another staff gave the wrong food to a customer. I'm always hit huhu.<br> I've also been short up to RM30 as long as I've been working as a cashier. Thank goodness it didn't reach a hundred. <br>That's my experience working as a cashier. There are joys and sorrows that I went through working as a cashier..</p>
